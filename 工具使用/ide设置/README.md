#ideSettings

There'are **webstorm** and **phpstorm** settings. I exported these settings to make sure settings in my workplace and my pc are the same.

- You should choose the **Scheme** of my name -- *Geoffrey* in preferences in "**Code Style**" and "**Colors & Fonts**".
- There are two types of keymap in "**Keymap**" named *MyMac* for Mac and *MyWindows* for Windows.
